    <h3>Hello,</h3>
    <br>
    <p>During one of your last visits to our campus you have been in contact with someone who has tested positive to Covid-19. We strongly recommend you to make an appointment with a testing facility.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>You have been excused from all physical courses until you've provided us with your test results.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Yours truly,
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Artevelde Staff
